    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arijit_Singh">Arjith Singh's musical career began when his guru Rajendra Prasad Hazari, who felt that "Indian classical music was a dying tradition", insisted him to leave his hometown and participate in the reality show Fame Gurukul (2005) at the age of 18.[16][18] He was eliminated by audience polling, finishing in sixth place.[19]

During the show, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali recognized his talent and had him sing "Yun Shabnami" a song scheduled to be used in his upcoming film Saawariya. During production, the script changed and the song was no longer required. It was never released.[20] After the Fame Gurukul, Kumar Taurani, the head of Tips, signed him for an album which was never released.</a>
